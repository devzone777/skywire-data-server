# Skywire Data Server
This is a base application for building a new server for use within the Skywire Mainnnet environment.
A supporting client template is available to use for testing and to build your client app. The purpose is to provide a minimum 
viable working template for you to use to build your own server. The templates are meant to be used to build apps that will be compiled and run within the Skywire Mainnet directory via "make build/make install" commands and configuration is to be done in the skywire-config.json file.

### With  this repository you can:
- Build an application server (web, database, other)
- Build a client to test application server
- Deploy on the Skywire network

### Getting Started
Use app.template to start writing the skywire application binary
